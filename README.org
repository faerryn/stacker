* STACKER
STACKER is a buggy, non-conformal interpreter for a subset of [[https://www.forth.com/][FORTH]], a
stack-based language.  STACKER diverges from FORTH standard in a
number of ways: STACKER is case-sensitive, it does not support FOTH's
dot-quote strings, and it forbids modifying already-defind words.
STACKER also has divergent behaviors, documented below.

Currently, STACKER implements the following:
- Data
  - int64
  - char8 (single-quoted with basic escape sequences)
- Arithmetic Operators
  - +
  - -
  - *
  - /
  - mod (non-conformal: [[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ResidueClass.html][residue class]])
  - rem (what normal FORTH mod does)
- Comparison Operators
  - >
  - <
  - '='
  - '<>'
- Logical Operations
  - and
  - or
  - invert
- Stack Operations
  - dup
  - drop
  - swap
  - over
  - rot
- Conditionals
  - if/then
  - if/else/then
- Loops
  - begin/until
  - begin/again
  - begin/while/repeat
- Storage
  - variable
  - !
  - @
- Optional
  - .s
  - bye
