* STACKER
STACKER is a buggy, non-conformal interpreter for a subset of [[https://www.forth.com/][FORTH]], a
stack-based language.  STACKER diverges from FORTH standard in a
number of ways: STACKER is case-sensitive, it does not support
FOTH-style strings, and it does not support dictionary operations.
STACKER also has divergent operator behaviors, documented below.

Currently, STACKER implements the following operators:
- [-] Arithmetic Operators
  - [-] `+`
  - [X] `-` (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - [X] `*`
  - [X] `/` (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - [X] `rem` (non-conformal: reversed order remainder)
  - [ ] `/rem`
  - [X] `mod` (non-conformal: reversed order residue class)
  - [ ] `/mod`
- [X] Comparison Operators
  - [X] `>` (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - [X] `<` (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - [X] '='
  - [X] '<>'
- [ ] Logical Operations
  - [ ] `and`
  - [ ] `or`
  - [ ] `invert`
- [X] Stack Operations
  - [X] `dup`
  - [X] `drop`
  - [X] `swap`
  - [X] `over`
  - [X] `rot`
- [-] Conditionals
  - [X] if/then
  - [ ] if/else/then
- [X] Loops
  - [X] begin/until
  - [X] begin/again
  - [X] begin/while/repeat
