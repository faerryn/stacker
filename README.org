* STACKER
STACKER is a buggy, non-conformal interpreter for a subset of [[https://www.forth.com/][FORTH]], a
stack-based language.  STACKER diverges from FORTH standard in a
number of ways: STACKER is case-sensitive, it does not support FOTH's
dot-quote strings, and it does not support dictionary operations.
STACKER also has divergent behaviors, documented below.

Currently, STACKER implements the following:
- Data
  - int64
  - char8 (single-quoted with escape sequences)
- Arithmetic Operators
  - +
  - - (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - *
  - / (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - rem (reversed order FORTH mod)
  - mod (non-conformal: reversed order [[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ResidueClass.html][residue class]])
- Comparison Operators
  - > (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - < (non-conformal: reversed order)
  - '='
  - '<>'
- Logical Operations
  - and
  - or
  - invert
- Stack Operations
  - dup
  - drop
  - swap
  - over
  - rot
- Conditionals
  - if/then
  - if/else/then
- Loops
  - begin/until
  - begin/again
  - begin/while/repeat
